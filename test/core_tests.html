  <!-- HTML elements to be tested with QUnit should typically be inside
       a qunit-fixture div. Unfortunately that just won't work with impress.js
       as it wants the div#impress element to be a direct child of body. Or
       something, I don't know, but it didn't work.
       
       So we just have an empty qunit-fixture, and then our impress steps
       just below it. This just means you have to make sure that each
       QUnit.test() cleans up after itself, can't rely on QUnit to do it now.
